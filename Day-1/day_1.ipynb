    "### **✤ What is Classification?**<br>\n",
    " - Classification is a machine learning technique used to categorize data into\n",
    "   different classes or categories.<br><br>\n",
    " - It is a supervised learning approach where the algorithm learns from labeled\n",
    "   training data to make predictions or classify new, unseen data.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✤ Applications of Classification**<br>\n",
    " \n",
    " Classification is used in various real-world applications, such as:<br><br>\n",
    "  ➤ **Spam email detection**<br>\n",
    "  ➤ **Credit risk assessment**<br>\n",
    "  ➤ **Disease diagnosis**<br>\n",
    "  ➤ **Image recognition**<br>\n",
    "  ➤ **Sentiment analysis**<br>\n",

    "### **✤ What is an API?**<br>\n",
    "  - API stands for Application Programming Interface.<br><br>\n",
    "  - It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to\n",
    "    communicate and interact with each other.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✤ Why use APIs?**<br>\n",
    "  - APIs enable developers to access the functionality of other applications or\n",
    "    services without having to understand their internal workings.<br><br>\n",
    "  - They provide a standardized way for applications to exchange data and\n",
    "    perform specific tasks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **✤ Types of APIs**<br>\n",
    "There are different types of APIs, including<br><br>\n",
    "  **1. Web APIs:** These are APIs exposed over the web using standard protocols\n",
    "   like HTTP, allowing developers to interact with remote services.<br><br>\n",
    "  **2. Library or Framework APIs:** These APIs are provided by libraries or frameworks and        \n",
    "   offer pre-defined functions and classes to simplify development.<br><br>\n",
    "  **3. Operating System APIs:** These APIs provide access to operating system features and  \n",
    "   functionalities, allowing developers to interact with the underlying system.<br><br>\n",
